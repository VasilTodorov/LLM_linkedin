# Context
I need assistance from you to filter job descriptions on linkedin. The job is entry-level software engineer for a person with no professional experience.
The problem is that they often say that they are entry-level, but are looking for junior or mid developers.
I will give you job descriptions from linkedin and you will provide a report with reasoning to me. Provide examples in the reasoning
I want you to tell me:
1. If the job is entry-level
2. If it is ambiguous, sometimes it is hard to tell if it is entry or not
3. If it is software engineer job. They try to pass different positions as job engineer.
4. How good my skills match(don't get into too much details here the previous points are more important)
5. Provide some short reasoning bellow.
